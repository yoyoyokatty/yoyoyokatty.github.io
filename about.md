I'm a recent graduate of General Assembly's Data Science program with 8 years of experience in all facets of advertising research across creative agencies, ad networks and publishers.

This blog is to house all the fun data science *experimental* projects I'm working on. Everything's a learning process for me so lessons will be learned through this!

Aside from that, I also enjoy terrible dancing, disco, cats and art.
