The task for this week was to use data from the FAA in order to understand the causes of airport delays.

---

## The Data

#### Given Dataset

3 datasets were given, consisting of:

- Airport Details: primarily composed of geography of specific airports
- Airport Cancellations: detailed information of cancellations and delays of airports from 2004 - 2014 
- Airport Operations: even more detailed information around delay/cancellation metrics with 10+ features related to delays. Also includes total flights taken.

For this task, the Airport Operations dataset was treated as the primary set of data. All other sets were merged with the primary one, given its relative wealth of information. 

#### Risks/Assumptions

Each airport and year were treated as individual observations. 

There were a few data points that were dropped as a result of merging data sets. This included airports GYY, TEB, and VNY, which did not appear in the Airport Cancellations set. Given that imputing the data was too risky, and that the data was not location specific, these airports were left off.

Furthermore, 2 airports were missing a few years of data, including PSP and SMF, both missing 2004-2006. Since each year was treated as an individual point, these were left as is.

The biggest risk with the dataset was overlapping features:

- MOST URGENT: As noted above, the Airport Operations dataset had nearly 10 features denoting various iterations of a "delay". The pairplot shows some of the potential issues with choosing a single target variable as a "delay" given the correlations between each of these features. This issue would require a larger methodology.

- URGENT: Geography was also overlapped as well. Airport details included FAA Region, County, City and State. Given potential collinearity, these would also have to be dealt with using a larger methodology. 
- KIND OF URGENT: There were also data points that provided metrics for both arrival and departures (resulting in nearly 1-to-1 correlated features). Only one of these was needed so arrivals were deleted to avoid collinearity.

## The Approach

Given the various issues that needed to be addressed with our dataset, a 2 part approach was implemented:

#### Part 1: Hone in on "Delays"

The goal of this part was to identify which feature(s) was the most salient in defining a delay. This was done by:

- Reducing overlapping "delay" features through PCA
- Outline which features contributed the most to the PCA
- Utilize the PCA to cluster each individual airport/year to draw larger macro trends

#### Part 2: Understand "Delay" Causes

Utilizing results from Part 1, the goal of Part 2 is to understand what other causes contributed to the larger "delay" metric:

- Reconfigure merged dataset with identified clusters from Part 1
- Identify which of the remaining features contribute the most to "delays"

## The Findings

#### Part 1: Hone in on "Delays"

After implementing PCA on delay focused features, the optimal number of components was 3, with a culmulative explained variance of 84.9:

When the correlations between each of the 3 PCAs and the original "delay" features was examined, it seemed nearly all the features had equal importance for PCA 1, as predicted.

However, Average Airport Departure Delay and Percent On-Time Airport Departures were slightly more salient for PCA 1 vs the the other features.

Using the PCA, and implementing KMeans, two distinct clusters were identified, with a Silhouette Score of .44:

With a relatively low silhouette score, the data could be further refined to increase the distance between clusters, but for the sake of this analysis, these 2 clusters were used to move forward with Part 2. 

#### Part 2: Understand "Delay" Causes

With 2 key clusters of airports and years, the next step was to identify the most salient features that drove the categorization of these clusters.

A Random Forest Classifer was ran against the two clusters for Year, Geo (City, State and FAA Region), and Total Flights.

The best performing model had a cross-validated R^2 score of .91 using FAA region, solving one of the data discpreancies noted above. The model also displayed the following feature importances:

|         Feature        | Relative Importance | 
|:----------------------:|---------------------|
| Total Departures       | .731                |
| Year                   | .116                |
| FAA: AEA (Eastern)     | .070                |
| FAA: AWP (West)        | .019                |
| FAA: AGL (Great Lakes) | .018                |

Feature importances denote that the total volume of flights coming out of an airport is the most salient factor in determining the airports with the most delays. 

High Delay airports tend to have more flights, vs Low Delay flights. Higher volume definitely contributes to more delays.

Differences between High and Low delay airports become apparent when examining regions. High Delay airports are concenterated in the Eastern area (AEA), whereas lower ones are represented in the West coast (AWP).

This becomes apparent when we examine the airports with the highest average airport departure delays, as the top 3 airports are located in AEA.

### Final Thoughts

Through this analysis, it is apparent that the most congested airports in the Northeast (not New England) are ones that are prone to delays, which is likely best measured by attributes such as Average Airport Departure Delay and Percent On-Time Airport Departures. 

In order to reduce the amount of delays, airports in the Northeast should consider potentially rerouting layover routes.
