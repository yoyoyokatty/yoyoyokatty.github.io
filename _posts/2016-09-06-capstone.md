## Predicting Album Cover Genres & Decades with Computer Vision

I've always had an interest in strange album covers from the 70s and 80s - there was typically a very distinct look to these covers that made it obvious that they were not of present time.

For my final project, I tested out my theory with machine learning techniques and predicted the genre and decade of album covers from the 1980s to present, across 13 different genres.

The final models utilized a convolutional neural network feature extractor with a support vector machine, with relatively strong results, particularly for the time period model.

Take a look at the full results and presentation [here](https://github.com/yoyoyokatty/DSI-projects/blob/master/Capstone_AlbumCovers/KL_PredictAlbumCoversCV_Capstone.pdf)
