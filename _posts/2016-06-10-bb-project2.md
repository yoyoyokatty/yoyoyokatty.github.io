For our project this week, we were tasked with uncovering how a song becomes a "successful" record in 2000 using data from the Billboard Top 100. The goal of this analysis is to ultimately uncover why humans like the music that we like. 

**How did we approach our analysis?**
Based off of our given data set, we evaluated 3 different types of factors that we thought could help identify a hit song:
- Genre of Song
- Length of Song
- Length of Time on Billboard for Song
We analyzed each factor one by one, to ultimately determined which conditition (or conditions!) were the drivers of hit songs. 
However, we hypothesize that the Length of Time on Billboard could potentially be the most salient factor out of the 3. Previous studies have cited that emotional centers of the brain are more active when they are hearing songs that they've already heard before* - meaning that the more you hear a song, the more you like it. 
Our assumption then is that songs on the Billboard for a longer time then, have had a higher chance of being heard more often, and thus will have a higher rank. Longevity of a song on the Billboard (implicitly, higher frequency of hearing song) is what makes a hit song, over any other factor.

**How do we define a "hit" song?**
In order to frame our analysis, we need to identify how we are measuring success. Because this data set is only the top 100 songs, technically, any song that ranks on here could be deemed as successful (317 songs). As an extra layer for this analysis though, we've also focused on ranks that have:
- Achieved #1 rank at any point and for any length of time during this time period (17 songs)
- Achieved rank from 1-24  at any point and for any length of time during this period (98 songs)
These two parameters are a way for us to compare against the overall Billboard Top 100 songs to gain a sense of what a truly hit song is, since they are essentially the most successful songs out of the group.

**Genre of Song - Does America have a Preferred Genre?**
*Successful songs tend to be Rock songs, but, this might be a result of an overcategorization*
<img src="/2016-06-22-bb-charts/Genre_distribution.png">
We first examined the genre make-up of the Billboard Top 100 compared to the #1 songs. Rock disproportionately makes up the bulk of the Billboard Top 100 (43%), followed by Country music. The proportion becomes even more exaggerated when we look at the #1 Ranked songs, coming in at 88%, twice the concentration of the overall Billboard 100. This concentration is likely because of the signficantly smaller sample size of the #1 songs but directionally shows how Rock dominates the Billboard. 
However, if we take a closer look though at the data, we noticed that there could potentially be an overcategorization of the Rock genre. Artists like Britney Spears, N'Sync, and even Destiny's Child have been categorized as Rock, despite having a Pop category.
Furthermore, when we examine the artists who have had the most songs on the list, we notice that the top 3 artists, Jay-Z (5 songs), a rap artist, and Dixie Chicks (4 songs), a country group, have been successful. The average amount of songs an artist has on the Billboard is 1.4.
As a result, although Rock disproportionately appears in the most successful songs, we should use this point directionally, due to potential miscategorization as well as knowing that specific artists that aren't Rock artists have a potential to be successful. 

**Length of Song - What's the Perfect Length of a Hit Song?**
*Song lengths do not seem to correlate with rank*

<img src = "boxplot of medians of all rank vs rank 1s">
The range between of all the songs in the Billboard top 100 was relatively large at 5m 14s. The longest song was nearly 8 minutes long (7m 50s), and the shortest song was only 2 and a half minutes long (2m 36s). Given this large span and sample size, it would not be surprising if there was an ideal song length.
However, when each song was matched against their rank and song length, we saw no clear pattern between each point. Even upon examination of the small subset of #1 only songs compared to the overall total, the median difference between the two gropus was only 4 seconds difference. 
In fact, the longest song in the whole set at 7m and 50s, hit its peak rank at 7, indicating that it was a fairly successful song, while the shortest song hit its peak rank at 45, still in the top half of the rank. 
Our analysis indicates that there is no strong preference for specific song lengths.

**Length of Time on Billboard for Song - Does Our Hypothesis Hold True?**
*Yes! Songs that have been on the Billboard longer are more successful*
<img src = "quartile and length on billboard">
When we reach our hypothesis, a correlation does exist! Due to the sheer volume of all Billboard songs, we split the rank into quartiles, examining the days it took to peak against ranges of ranks. From our analysis, we can see that songs that have taken a longer time to peak tend to have a more successful rank. Songs in the least successful ranks peaked in the shortest amount of time. 

**What Does This All Mean?**
The data indicates that there is a clear relationship between longer days to peak and successful songs. Although further investigation is required, this could imply that the more often you hear a song, the more likely you are to enjoy the song, and thus play it more often, thereby bettering the Billboard rank of a song. However long or short the song is likely does not matter, nor does the genre given the variations in categorizations of the Billboard rank.
