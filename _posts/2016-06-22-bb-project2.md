For our project this week, we were tasked with uncovering how a song becomes a "successful" record, using data from the Billboard Top 100 in 2000. The goal of this analysis was to ultimately uncover we like the music that we like.

##How did we approach our analysis?
Based off of our given data set, we evaluated 3 different factors that could help identify a hit song:
* Genre of Song
* Length of Song
* Length of Time on Billboard for Song
We analyzed each factor, to determined which conditition(s) were the drivers of hit songs. 
We hypothesized that the Length of Time on Billboard could potentially be the most salient factor out of the 3. Genres can be arbitrary - aside from the fact that genre tastes are constantly fluctuating (Latin Invasion of the 2000s, and EDM today), genre categorization is rarely black and white.  We did expect though that song length could potentially have an impact - a song shouldn't be too short or too long to be a hit. This impact would be minimal though, as long as a song didn't fall in the extremes of too short or too long. 
On the other hand, previous studies have cited that emotional centers of the brain are more active when hearing songs that have already been heard[[^1]]. Or, in layman terms, the more you hear a song, the more you like it. 
Our hypothesis then is that songs that have been on the Billboard for a longer time, have had a higher chance of being heard more often, and thus will have a higher rank. Longevity of a song on the Billboard (implicitly, songs that have had more exposure to people) is what makes a hit song over any other factor. 

##How do we define a "hit" song?
In order to frame our analysis, we needed to define "success" or "hits". Because this data set was only the top 100 songs, technically, any song that ranked on here could be deemed as successful (317 songs). As an extra layer for this analysis though, we've also focused on songs that have:
* Achieved #1 peak rank at any point and for any length of time (17 songs)
* Achieved #1-24 peak rank at any point and for any length of time (98 songs)
These two cuts were a way for us to compare against the overall Billboard Top 100 songs, and are used accordingly through the subsequent analysis.
Also, all analyses were done on peak rank for each song, regardless of the rank.

##Genre of Song - Does America have a Preferred Genre?
####Successful songs tended to be Rock songs, but, this might be a result of an overcategorization
![genre_distrbution](http://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)
We first examined the genre make-up of the Billboard Top 100 compared to the #1 songs. Rock disproportionately made up the bulk of the Billboard Top 100 (43%), followed by Country music. The proportion became even more exaggerated when we look at the #1 Ranked songs, where Rock made up 88%, twice the concentration of the overall Billboard 100. This concentration was likely because of the signficantly smaller sample size of the #1 songs, but directionally showed how Rock dominated the Billboard. 
However, if we take a closer look though at the data, we noticed that there could potentially be an overcategorization of the Rock genre. Artists like Britney Spears, N'Sync, and even Destiny's Child have been categorized as Rock, despite having a Pop category.
Furthermore, when we examine the artists who have had the most songs on the list, we notice that the top 3 artists, Jay-Z (5 songs), a rap artist, and Dixie Chicks (4 songs), a country group, have been successful. The average amount of songs an artist has on the Billboard is 1.4:

######Top 3 Artists with the Most Songs on Billboard 100
| Artist           | Genre   | Song Count|
| ---------------- |:-------:| ---------:|
| Jay-Z            | Rap     |         5 |
| The Dixie Chicks | Country |         4 |
| Whitney Houston  | Rock    |         4 |

So, although Rock disproportionately appeared in the most successful songs, we used this point directionally, due to potential miscategorization, as well as knowing that specific artists that aren't Rock artists also were successful. 

##Length of Song - What's the Perfect Length of a Hit Song?
####Song lengths do not seem to correlate with rank
<img src = "bfullscatterplot">
<img src = "boxplot of medians of all rank vs rank 1s">
The range between of all the songs in the Billboard top 100 was relatively large at 5m 14s. The longest song was nearly 8 minutes long (7m 50s), and the shortest song was only 2 and a half minutes long (2m 36s). Given this large span and sample size, it would not be surprising if there was an ideal song length.
However, when each song was matched against their rank and song length, we saw no clear pattern between each point. Even upon examination of the small subset of #1 only songs compared to the overall total, the median difference between the two gropus was only 4 seconds difference. 
In fact, the longest song in the whole set at 7m and 50s, hit its peak rank at 7, indicating that it was a fairly successful song, while the shortest song hit its peak rank at 45, still in the top half of the rank. 
Our analysis indicates that there is no strong preference for specific song lengths.

##Length of Time on Billboard for Song - Does Our Hypothesis Hold True?
####Yes! Songs that have been on the Billboard longer are more successful
<img src = "quartile and length on billboard">
When we reach our hypothesis, a correlation does exist! Due to the sheer volume of all Billboard songs, we split the rank into quartiles, examining the days it took to peak against ranges of ranks. From our analysis, we can see that songs that have taken a longer time to peak tend to have a more successful rank. Songs in the least successful ranks peaked in the shortest amount of time.

##What Does This All Mean?
The data indicates that there is a clear relationship between longer days to peak and successful songs. Although further investigation is required, this could imply that the more often you hear a song, the more likely you are to enjoy the song, and thus play it more often, thereby bettering the Billboard rank of a song. However long or short the song is likely does not matter, nor does the genre given the variations in categorizations of the Billboard rank.
