For our project this week, we were tasked with uncovering how a song becomes a "successful" record, using data from the Billboard Top 100 in 2000. The goal of this analysis was to figure out why we like the music that we like.

## How did we approach our analysis?

Based off of our given data set, we evaluated 3 different factors that could help identify a hit song:

- Genre of Song
- Length of Song
- Length of Time on Billboard

We analyzed each factor to determine which condition(s) were the drivers of hit songs in 2000. 

All analyses were done on peak rank for each song. 

In order to frame our analysis, we needed to define "success" for our "hits". Because this data set was only the top 100 songs, technically, any song that ranked could be successful (317 songs). As an extra layer for this analysis though, we also focused on songs that have:

- Achieved #1 peak rank at any point and for any length of time (17 songs)
- Achieved #1-24 peak rank at any point and for any length of time (98 songs)

These two cuts were a way for us to compare against the overall Billboard Top 100.


#### Our hypothesis

We hypothesized that the Length of Time on Billboard was the most salient factor out of the 3. Genres can be arbitrary - aside from the fact that genre tastes are constantly fluctuating (e.g. Latin Invasion, EDM, disco, etc.), genre categorization is rarely black and white. We did expect though that song length would have an impact - a song shouldn't be too short or too long to be a hit. 

On the other hand, previous studies have cited that emotional centers of the brain are more active when hearing songs that have already been heard[[^1]]. Or, in layman terms, the more you hear a song, the more you like it. 

Therefore, our hypothesis is that songs that have been on the Billboard for a longer time, have had a higher chance of being heard more often, and thus would have a higher rank. Longevity of a song on the Billboard would be what made a hit song over any other factor.

## Genre of Song - Does America have a Preferred Genre?

#### Directionally, successful songs tended to be Rock songs

![genre_distrbution](http://yoyoyokatty.github.io/images_kl/project2-bb/Genre_distribution.png)
Rock disproportionately made up the bulk of the Billboard Top 100 (43%), followed by Country music. The proportion became exaggerated when we focused on #1 Rank, where Rock made up 88%, twice the concentration of the overall Billboard 100. This concentration was likely because of the signficantly smaller sample size of the #1 songs, but directionally showed how Rock dominated hit songs. 

However, if we take a closer look at the data, there could potentially be an overcategorization of the Rock genre. Artists like Sisqo, Destiny's Child and N'Sync have been categorized as Rock, despite their cross over into R&B and Pop. All these artists have also held #1 ranked songs during this time, thus explaining the skew.  

Furthermore, when we examined the artists who have had the most songs on the list, we noticed that the top 2 artists, Jay-Z, a rap artist, and Dixie Chicks, a country group, were not of the Rock genre. The average amount of songs an artist has on the Billboard is 1.4 comparatively:

#### Top 3 Artists with the Most Songs on Billboard 100

|      Artist      | Genre   | Song Count |
|:----------------:|---------|------------|
| Jay-Z            | Rap     | 5          |
| The Dixie Chicks | Country | 4          |
| Whitney Houston  | Rock    | 4          |

So, although Rock disproportionately appeared in the most successful songs, we must use this point directionally, due to potential miscategorization, and to take into account successful outliers in other genres. 



## Length of Song - What's the Perfect Length of a Hit Song?

#### Song lengths did not seem to correlate with rank

![Song_length_distribution](http://yoyoyokatty.github.io/images_kl/project2-bb/Song_length_distribution.png)

When each rank was matched with its distributed song length, we saw no clear pattern - the medians of each distribution did not show any correlation. This was surprising given the relatively large range of the set (over 5 minutes).

Our initial assumptions were that hit songs likely had an ideal range. But, as seen in the distribution, the longest song in the whole set at 7m and 50s, hit its peak rank at 7, indicating that it was a fairly successful song. Meanwhile the shortest song hit its peak rank at 45. Considering that the median of all songs was 3 minutes and 56 seconds, the max and the min performance, as well as the overall performance of the Billboard 100 shows no real correlation between song length and rank.


![Song_length_distribution](http://yoyoyokatty.github.io/images_kl/project2-bb/Song_length_distribution_RankOne.png)

To ensure there was no relationship, we focused on the smaller sample of #1 songs to compare against the overall rank. Even with this extra pull, the median difference between the two gropus was only 4 seconds difference. 

Our analysis thus indicated that there was no strong preference for specific song lengths.



## Length of Time on Billboard for Song - Does Our Hypothesis Hold True?

#### Yes! Songs that have been on the Billboard longer were more successful

![Days_peaked_distribution](http://yoyoyokatty.github.io/images_kl/project2-bb/Days_peaked_distribution.png)

Due to the sheer volume of all Billboard songs, we split the rank into quartiles, and examined the days it took to get to peak rank. We can see that songs that have taken a longer time to peak tend to have a more successful rank, from both the median and even the outliers. Songs in the least successful ranks peaked in the shortest amount of time. 

Even when adding on the smaller sample of #1 songs, we see that the median is slightly higher than even the top quartile of songs. Given the pattern of the lower ranked quartiles, we can assume that our hypothesis was correct.

## What Does This All Mean?

The data indicates that there is a clear relationship between longer days to peak and successful songs. Although further investigation is required, this could imply that the more often you hear a song, the more likely you are to enjoy the song, and thus play it more often, thereby bettering the Billboard rank of a song. 

However long or short the song is likely does not matter, nor does the genre given the variations in categorizations of the Billboard rank.
